Hi...

I'm a lead...

I'm a big nerd, just like all of you.

...

I have a LEGO city in my basement...
My spouse and I print all sorts of fidgets...
I'm in 2 local queer community bands where I play clarinet and trumpet...
There's more, but John'll kill me if I go over 

But most importantly...

I'm Livewire's Biggest Fan..., and have been since 2018...
